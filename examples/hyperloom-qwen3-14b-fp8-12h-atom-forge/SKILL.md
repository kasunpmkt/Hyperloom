# Hyperloom Qwen3-14B-FP8 12h Run (ATOM Framework, Forge Kernel Backend)

Load `.env` with the execution-shell preamble below and resolve
`HYPERLOOM_SKILL_PATH`. Follow `@${HYPERLOOM_SKILL_PATH}`; if unset, use
`@hyperloom/inference_optimizer/SKILL.md` (wheel installation) or
`@src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/SKILL.md` (source checkout). This ATOM variant
uses the same workload and phase budgets as the
[12h SGLang/vLLM example](../hyperloom-qwen3-14b-fp8-12h/SKILL.md).

This is the [12h ATOM example](../hyperloom-qwen3-14b-fp8-12h-atom/SKILL.md) with
**one** difference: the KERNEL_AGENT phase runs the per-kernel KernelForge
backend instead of GEAK. The workload, budget, and phase split are identical on
purpose, so the two runs stay directly comparable.

## Run Mode

Follow the setup skill's **Run Mode Resolution**, shared with the vLLM/SGLang
workflow. Reuse the user's `HYPERLOOM_RUN_MODE` selection (`baremetal` or `docker`)
from setup, the caller, or `.env`. If no valid selection is available, ask the user
to choose before setup, container creation, or launch. Do not default to either mode
or infer a preference from the framework or a previous validation run.

- `docker`: run in an ATOM container on the selected development host.
- `baremetal`: run directly in that host's existing ATOM/ROCm Python environment.
  A development platform that is itself a container still counts as baremetal
  when no additional Docker container is started.

Export the selected `HYPERLOOM_RUN_MODE` in the execution shell and run only its
matching entry below; both entries use the same Environment and Launch steps.

### Execution shell

In the chosen Hyperloom workspace, use the shared loader with caller exports
taking precedence. Repeat this preamble in each new execution shell, including
inside Docker, with the selected `HYPERLOOM_RUN_MODE` exported. Keep
`USER_DATA_PATH` unchanged; the loader handles readonly roots and Docker's host
Python isolation without a new shell.

```bash
set -e
export REPO_ROOT="$(pwd -P)"
INSTALL_SH="${REPO_ROOT}/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh"
if [ ! -f "$INSTALL_SH" ]; then
  INSTALL_SH="${REPO_ROOT}/src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh"
fi
. "${INSTALL_SH%/*}/runtime_env.sh"
load_dotenv_no_clobber
export FRAMEWORK=atom
export KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER=forge
export PYTHONPATH="${REPO_ROOT}:${REPO_ROOT}/src:${PYTHONPATH:-}"
```

### Baremetal

After choosing direct execution, select the mode in that execution shell:

```bash
export HYPERLOOM_RUN_MODE=baremetal
```

Activate the existing ATOM environment, or select its executable with `PYTHON`.
Continue with [Environment](#environment) below; do not run any Docker commands.

### Docker container

Only after the user selects `HYPERLOOM_RUN_MODE=docker`: use the approved
`HYPERLOOM_DOCKER_TARGET_HOST`, or the current development host if unset. Do not
create containers or run setup/optimize on a login host. Reuse completed setup
only in the actual execution environment, not a different host Python.

Suggested MI355X image: `docker.io/rocm/atom-dev:v0.1.7-rc0`; preserve an explicit
`HYPERLOOM_IMAGE`. Choose an image compatible with the target GPU.
After approval, mount the workspace at the same absolute path. Add matching
mounts for `USER_DATA_PATH` and any model directory outside the workspace:

```bash
export HYPERLOOM_RUN_MODE=docker
export REPO_ROOT="$(pwd -P)"
export HYPERLOOM_IMAGE="${HYPERLOOM_IMAGE:-docker.io/rocm/atom-dev:v0.1.7-rc0}"
docker run -d --init \
  --name "${HYPERLOOM_CONTAINER_NAME:-hyperloom-local}" \
  --shm-size "${HYPERLOOM_SHM_SIZE:-64g}" \
  --entrypoint tail \
  --device /dev/kfd \
  --device /dev/dri \
  --group-add video \
  -v "$REPO_ROOT:$REPO_ROOT" \
  "$HYPERLOOM_IMAGE" \
  -f /dev/null
```

Enter the container and feed the shared steps below to Bash. This non-TTY form
forwards exported selections by name without printing their values; use `-it`
instead of `-i` for an interactive terminal. Add any other required shell-only
credential/provider variables to the list. Mounted `.env` supplies missing values.
Do not forward host `PYTHON`, `PATH`, or venv settings: select the container's
existing ATOM environment after entry.

```bash
set -e
_atom_container_env=()
for _atom_name in HYPERLOOM_RUN_MODE USER_DATA_PATH MODEL_PATH KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER CLAW_SESSION_ID \
  FORGE_AGENT_BACKEND FORGE_AGENT_CLI CLAUDE_MODEL CODEX_MODEL HYPERLOOM_SKILL_PATH \
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN OPENAI_API_KEY OPENAI_BASE_URL; do
  if printenv "$_atom_name" > /dev/null; then
    _atom_container_env+=(--env "$_atom_name")
  fi
done
unset _atom_name
docker exec -i -w "$REPO_ROOT" "${_atom_container_env[@]}" \
  "${HYPERLOOM_CONTAINER_NAME:-hyperloom-local}" bash
```

Inside that shell, repeat the [execution-shell preamble](#execution-shell), then
run Environment, Runtime Install, and Launch Requirements below. Repeat the
preamble and Python selection for each new `docker exec` shell. Stop this session's
container only with approval after the run finishes.

### Prior workload cleanup (required)

Before replacement launches, follow **IR-1 — Prior workload cleanup gate** in the
packaged optimizer skill, on the direct environment or Docker target as applicable.
ATOM worker command lines can omit the server entrypoint. Identify this session's
PIDs, process groups, ports and container before proposing cleanup; never broadly
kill Python workers or restart the machine. Check GPU usage before GPU work:

```bash
rocm-smi --showmemuse
pgrep -af "openai_server|spawn_main"
```

## Environment

Both modes use the following steps in the shell where ATOM will run.

### Framework

ATOM must already be installed with ROCm torch. Hyperloom does not install ATOM:
use `--install-framework none --frameworks atom --require-frameworks` below.
This example is single-node, fixes `FRAMEWORK=atom`, and lets Hyperloom detect the
GPU rather than passing `--gpu-type`.

For additional serving settings, use the optimizer's `--server-args` option.
Do not launch a separate server or export `EXTRA_ATOM_ARGS`: Hyperloom materializes
that transport variable. Keep the initial configuration untuned; do not copy
another GPU's block/KV settings or the final settings of a previous optimization.
Persist `FRAMEWORK=atom` in `.env` only when requested.

### Kernel Backend

`KERNEL_OPT_BACKEND_ORDER=forge` in the [execution-shell
preamble](#execution-shell) is the only switch this example needs, and it is what
separates this run from the [12h ATOM
example](../hyperloom-qwen3-14b-fp8-12h-atom/SKILL.md). The opt-in is an **exact**
match on `forge`; every other value, including unset and `forge,geak`, leaves GEAK
owning the whole kernel phase. There is no backend CLI flag, so leaving the export
out silently produces a GEAK run that looks like this demo but is not — confirm the
value is actually set in the launching shell and report it before launch.

Forge is included in Hyperloom; do not clone it or set `FORGE_PATH`. Preserve the
selected agent provider and `FORGE_AGENT_CLI`; the runtime installer prepares and
checks that CLI unconditionally, because the backend is chosen per session.

### Selected Python and Setup

Activate the existing ATOM venv or select an explicit `PYTHON`; otherwise use
`python3` from PATH. Do not create a fresh venv or require `/opt/venv`.

```bash
export PYTHON="${PYTHON:-$(command -v python3)}"
export INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_FORCE_PYTHON=1
```

Setup checks the selected Python, ROCm torch and ATOM import/server readiness.
Run its read-only check even when setup previously completed:

```bash
"$PYTHON" -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.setup --check-only -- \
  --install-framework none --frameworks atom --require-frameworks \
  --user-data-path "${USER_DATA_PATH:?USER_DATA_PATH missing}"
```

Reuse successful setup in this environment. Only if setup is needed, explain its
changes and obtain approval before running:

```bash
"$PYTHON" -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.setup -- \
  --install-framework none --frameworks atom --require-frameworks \
  --user-data-path "${USER_DATA_PATH:?USER_DATA_PATH missing}" --yes
```

`none` skips framework installation only: actual setup writes `.env` and may
apply ROCm hotfixes; `--yes` is not user consent. Do not bypass base checks, repeat
onboarding unnecessarily, or install SGLang/vLLM to compensate for missing ATOM.

### Model

Ask the operator to choose the existing `MODEL_PATH`, a custom local directory,
or the demo default `Qwen/Qwen3-14B-FP8`. A chosen local directory must contain
`config.json`; resolve the path in the actual execution environment.

For the demo default, use `${REPO_ROOT}/.cache/hyperloom-models/Qwen3-14B-FP8` when
no local path was selected. Use the selected Python, not an assumed Hugging Face
CLI. If `huggingface_hub` is missing, obtain approval before installing it with
`"$PYTHON" -m pip install huggingface_hub`.

```bash
export MODEL_PATH="${MODEL_PATH:-${REPO_ROOT}/.cache/hyperloom-models/Qwen3-14B-FP8}"
"$PYTHON" - <<'PY'
import os
from pathlib import Path
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

target = Path(os.environ["MODEL_PATH"]).expanduser()
if (target / "config.json").is_file():
    print(f"Using existing model at {target.resolve()}")
else:
    snapshot_download(
        repo_id="Qwen/Qwen3-14B-FP8",
        local_dir=str(target),
    )
print(target.resolve())
PY
```

## Pre-launch Runtime Install

Prepare runtime in the same environment as ATOM, using the existing installer.
Reuse a prepared runtime; installation needs approval because it installs
dependencies and may start services. If shell and setup-written `.env` disagree
on `USER_DATA_PATH`, reconcile the selected root first: the installer treats
setup's `.env` as authoritative. Never silently replace the artifact root.

Use the execution-shell preamble and selected Python above, then run:

```bash
: "${USER_DATA_PATH:?USER_DATA_PATH missing}" "${PYTHON:?Select the existing ATOM Python first}"
export USER_DATA_PATH
ulimit -Sn 65536 || true
bash "$INSTALL_SH"
```

For every launch, including resume, the optimizer loads `kernel-agent.env.sh`
in process. Startup preflight checks the selected framework. Do not source the
generated runtime file in
the shell. Readiness failures require diagnosis and approval for repairs, not a provider switch.

## Launch Requirements

Use the packaged optimizer skill's **Launch a New Optimization** instructions to
prepare `RUN_LOG`, `PID_FILE`, `LAUNCH_INFO_FILE` and run-scoped metadata in this
execution environment. Keep the selected ATOM Python and backend for launch.

### First launch

After setup and runtime preparation, use this complete command for both modes.
Do not replace workload flags with environment-only settings or add
`--no-framework-agent` / `--no-kernel`:

```bash
set -e
: "${PYTHON:?PYTHON missing}" "${MODEL_PATH:?MODEL_PATH missing}"
: "${RUN_LOG:?RUN_LOG missing}" "${LAUNCH_INFO_FILE:?LAUNCH_INFO_FILE missing}"
"$PYTHON" -m hyperloom.inference_optimizer.cli --verbose optimize \
  --model "$MODEL_PATH" \
  --framework atom \
  --tp 1 --conc 64 --isl 1024 --osl 1024 \
  --precision fp8 \
  --target-gain 50 --max-hours 12 \
  --max-minutes-framework-pct 0.43 --max-minutes-kernel-pct 0.42 \
  --launch-info-file "$LAUNCH_INFO_FILE" \
  > "$RUN_LOG" 2>&1 < /dev/null
```

Detach through the existing harness-aware launch path: when `CLAW_SESSION_ID` is
set and the Bash tool supports `run_in_background`, use it without shell-level
detachment; otherwise prefix the optimize command with `setsid nohup` and append
`&`. Follow the packaged skill's separate health check and launch-info/PID
reconciliation; a shell wrapper PID is not the optimizer PID. Do not create a
second launcher or watchdog for baremetal.

### Resume

After the first launch, never start another fresh `optimize` to recover a failed
run. Diagnose it, obtain explicit approval, and pass `--resume-from "$SESSION_DIR"`
for that same session instead of a new model launch. Repeat the execution-shell
preamble and Python selection, retain phase fractions `.43/.42`, and follow IR-1
for any remaining ATOM workers before relaunching. Do not assume resume rewrites
launch-info: verify the current process and session state rather than using an old
PID. A final `stop_reason` ends the run; do not automatically restart it.

## User-visible Progress

Follow the packaged skill's **Monitoring** and **Report Back To User** rules.
Report the chosen mode, Python, model, framework/backend, workload and artifact
root before launch, then the real PID, session directory, log/launch-info paths
and initial health check. Never print credentials or custom header values.

Confirm the recorded framework/backend immediately, not just the shell exports:

```bash
grep -o '"framework": *"[^"]*"' "$SESSION_DIR/state.json"
grep -o '"kernel_optimizer": *"[^"]*"' "$SESSION_DIR/state.json"
```

Expect `atom` and `forge`. A recorded `geak` means the export did not reach the
launching shell: report the mismatch without silently replacing the session. On
requested checks report process state, phase, accepted throughput/gain and the
latest business outcome, not just heartbeats.

At completion, report final throughput/gain and accuracy evidence, the final
report path, stop reason, incomplete phases, and this session's process/GPU state.
