"""The SBD V6 ``phase`` event: where the run was, and what it dispatched there.

Every other event is scoped by a phase, but the phases themselves were only
derived at export: from ``phase_history`` rows paired two at a time, so the
segment the session ended in had no successor to close it, and by testing each
action's timestamp against ``[entered_ts, exit_ts)``, which charges an action
outliving its phase to whichever phase inherited it. So the phase becomes an
event, opened on entry and closed on exit, and each dispatch records its own
phase at the moment it is dispatched.

:data:`SECTION_ACTION` rows stay thin -- identity, the ordering phase, the
verdict -- because the stage events hold the per-dispatch detail and joining on
``task_id`` reaches it. For ``report``, ``recover``, ``session_breakdown`` and
``target_analysis``, which no stage event covers, the join finds nothing and
these rows are the only record.

Nothing here holds a recorder object, for the same reason the enablement event
does not: the call sites live in different modules on different ticks.
