    it), ``no_improvement`` (the visit ran and nothing measured a gain) or

    judged). It is empty on a visit that never concluded -- one rebuilt from
    the rows a killed session left behind -- because the rows may add up to a
    gain nobody ever concluded, and the event's ``interrupted`` status is the
    only statement such a visit supports.

    The subject is the visit, not the eventual fate of what it produced. A
    forge patch is gated end to end after this visit exits, and that verdict
    lands on the event of the cycle that ran the gate, so a verdict waiting on
    it could never be stated here at all. Follow ``delivered`` into a later
    event's ``integrate`` rows for that.

    ``reason`` says why whenever the verdict is not an improvement.
    ``error_class`` and ``failed_stage`` name a fault the visit hit, which is
    not the same as the verdict: a raising tick is filed against the session's
    crash count and the loop carries on, so a visit can fault somewhere and

    empty-handed visit from one that blew up, and a clean win from one that
    was not come by cleanly.
