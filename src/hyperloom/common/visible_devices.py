"""Visible-device mask names and parsing, shared by every layer that reads one.

The same tuple of mask variables and the same "split on ``,``/``;``, keep the
first occurrence of each non-negative int" parser had accumulated five separate
copies (``bus/gpu_pool``, ``policy/gate``, ``actions/executors/_ray_serving``,
``common/env_safety``, ``loop/coordinator_helpers``), and their empty-mask
semantics had already drifted apart. This module is the single definition; it
imports nothing outside the standard library so the pure-helper layers can use
it without dragging in the SQLite connection ``gpu_pool`` owns.

Two var tuples, deliberately distinct:

* :data:`COUNTING_VISIBLE_DEVICE_VARS` — what ``gpu_pool`` / ``gate`` consult to
  answer "how many GPUs does this process have". Identical to what those layers
  always used; widening it would change GPU accounting repo-wide. It is DERIVED
  from the chain below by subtracting an explicit exclusion set, so the two can
  never drift: a new var is counted unless someone names it as uncounted, and a
  test asserts every chain member is classified.
* :data:`VISIBLE_DEVICE_VARS` — the full ROCm pin-resolution chain, used when
  answering "where is this run pinned". ``HSA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` is ROCr's legacy
  name and ``GPU_DEVICE_ORDINAL`` is the legacy HIP-level filter; a run pinned
  with either is really pinned, and omitting them left it reported as unpinned.

The ROCr-level and HIP-level groups are exposed separately because the
distinction is load-bearing: a ROCr-level mask renumbers the devices the child
sees (so ids inside it are LOGICAL), while a HIP-level mask indexes into
whatever ROCr already exposed (so its ids are absolute unless a ROCr mask is
also in force).
