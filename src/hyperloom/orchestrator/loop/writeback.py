        task row may already be in a terminal state on resume.  Without this
        recovery the pending flag stays set indefinitely and the next
        revalidation cannot be enqueued (tracked_tid is still the old row).

        Which recovery depends on how the row ended, not on this being the resume
        path. A row the run cancelled -- which is what the queue scan does to a
        revalidation the wall-clock budget can no longer fit -- measured nothing
        and produced no result to route, so it is no evidence about the baseline
        and gets :meth:`_reopen_revalidation_window`, the same verdict the
        writeback reaches for the same round. Anything else ended having had its
        chance: the window closes and the round charges an observation carrying
        no evidence, which spends an evidence-stall credit.
