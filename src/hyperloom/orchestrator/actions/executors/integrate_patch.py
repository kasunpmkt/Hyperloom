        A round is accepted when the boot runs or reaches a deeper wall, and its
        writes then stay in the tree for the next round to build on; ``kept`` and
        ``advanced`` differ only in whether the lane is finished. Anything short
        of that reverts to the state the previous round left.

        The verdict depends on the trigger origin, because the two origins have
        different evidence available:

        * ``accuracy >= floor`` -> ``correctness_ok=True`` (KEEP, verified).
          eval-origin additionally requires the score to carry a task + metric;
          without them it did not come from a real eval and fails closed.
        * present but below floor / non-positive / non-finite ->
          ``correctness_ok=False`` (REVERT, garbage output).
        * ``accuracy is None`` -> eval-origin fails closed
          (``correctness_ok=False``): the trigger *was* an accuracy failure, so a
          candidate that produces no score has not shown it fixed anything.
          boot-origin stays ``None`` (KEEP but provisional) — it only ever
          claimed to make the model boot, and eval-less runs must not be blocked.

        On KEEP the benched env/arg layers are reported as
        ``enablement_effective_config``, captured from the variant that ran: the
        materialized YAML holds only the base layer, so the revalidation baseline
        needs them to re-run the graded config.
        When an attempt runtime was provisioned, the stack action is recorded in
        the result (``enablement_kept_stack_action``) so it survives rearm. On
        REVERT / non-KEEP, the attempt runtime dir is GC'd.

        come from the accepted round's own materialized config -- the same
        artifact the launch read -- overlaid with the runtime override, because

        comparable across a session that has accumulated several rewrite patches.
        It is also the invariant an LLM is most likely to break by accident — by
        reading the switch once at import, inverting a default, or restructuring
        code outside the guard — and nothing else in the pipeline would notice: a
        switches-on bench that improves throughput looks like a success whether or
        not the switches-off path still works.

        So it is measured, not assumed. One extra leg with the switches removed
